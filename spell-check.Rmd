## Website book description

```{r}
spelling::spell_check_text(
  text = '
  In 2018, I had virtually no online presence other than about 100 random LinkedIn connections. I knew this was a problem given my budding interest in Data Science, the increasing demand for project portfolios, and the perceived need to “stand out” in the digital crowd.

So, I learned how to publish my first personal website, Abnormal Distributions. Yes, I know, it looks outdated and definitely not as cool as this personal website. However, Abnormal Distributions served as the launchpad for growing my online presence. Since going live, it has served over 50,000 page views and 20,000 users from all over the world. I began posting content on LinkedIn with links to my website, and in the span of a year I received 1,700 LinkedIn connection requests from Data Scientists and professionals in related fields. I began receiving job opportunities from recruiters who would reference Abnormal Distributions as the reason for wanting to connect. Abnormal Distributions turned out to be a wonderful investment of time and energy and an amazing learning experience. It helped spark my creativity, deepen my subject matter expertise through writing, and give me the confidence to engage with the digital crowd.

Create, Publish, and Analyze Personal Websites Using R and RStudio aims to teach you step-by-step how to launch your very own personal website, such as a blog or portfolio. You will learn the exact methdology that I use to create, design, publish, and analyze websites using R, RStudio, and other freely available tools including GitHub, Hugo, Netlify, and Google Analytics. All of the tools presented in this book are free to download or available through free accounts. No prior experience in web development, R, or any of the aforementioned technologies is needed to be successful with this book.
